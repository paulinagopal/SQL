# Paulina Gopal's SQL Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL portfolio! 

This repository showcases examples of SQL queries and projects I’ve worked on as part of my learning and development in data analytics, with a focus on people and customer data.

# You'll find:

- Practice queries for common business-like scenarios

- Subqueries, joins, aggregations and filtering examples

- Clean, well-commented code for readability as I continue building and refining my skills.

I’m currently exploring opportunities as a Data Analyst, particularly in roles involving people or customer data. Feel free to explore and reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss the work.
